      'Melbourne\'s fan culture is uniquely obsessive and spans an extraordinary range of sports. AFL is religion — every Melburnian has a team, and the rivalry between clubs like Collingwood, Carlton, Essendon, and Richmond drives conversation year-round. The MCG on Grand Final day is one of the greatest spectacles in world sport. Cricket fans bring eskies full of beer to the Boxing Day Test and the atmosphere is festive and relentless. Australian Open crowds are knowledgeable and passionate, especially for night sessions under the lights. The city\'s cafe culture and laneway bars provide the perfect pre-match ritual.
