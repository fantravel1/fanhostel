## 🧠 Core Philosophy

FanHostel is **not a booking site**.  
It is a **fan-first lodging knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- map hostels to event calendars
- cluster stays by fan vibe and team/artist alignment
- translate fan culture across languages
- generate pre-game and post-show itineraries

Humans are required to:
- verify safety and accessibility
- validate fan dynamics
- prevent misinformation
- avoid glorifying unsafe behavior

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

FanHostel is built around **fan, event, and lodging entities**.

### Core Entities
- Hostel
- City
- Stadium / Arena / Venue
- Event (Game / Match / Concert)
- Fan Base / Supporter Group
- Vibe Category
- Price Tier
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by event, team/artist, and timing
- is programmatically generatable
